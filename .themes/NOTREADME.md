### INSTALL

To install, place each theme folder in the (.themes) folder in your home folder.
If that folder doesn't exist, create it.  It will be a, "hidden," folder, so
you may have to enable the showing of hidden files and folders in your file 
browsing program.  For Caja this setting can be found under (edit>preferences).

Also, perform the following, in a terminal, as root or with sudo:

`apt install qt5ct qt5-style-plugins`

After that, you can run the following, in a terminal, as your normal user:

`qt5ct`

From this program you can select gtk2 under the (style) selection.
Qt5 applications will subsequently render the gtk2 portion of the themes as 
well.

That should be it.  Modify these instructions as needed for non-debian-based 
distributions.  If `qt5ct` gives you an error/warning that prevents it from 
functioning, as it might, just search the Internet for the particular error; 
there should be a solution.

### ABOUT

These themes are a modification of the default theme, 
"High Contrast Inverse."  Essentially it came down to using the Pluma 
text-editor and a lot of the, "find and replace," function.  
It's all based off a now dated version of that theme, which came with a 
particular version of the Mate Desktop Environment, of which I can't recall.

There may be bugs and the themes are far from organized and perfect; but, after 
hacking away for some time, things look nice enough that they have been usable 
for me, for some time now.  I've been meaning to upload and share my work for 
some years now; but, things were never polished enough for me to feel it 
was worth doing so.  Anyway, I finally expanded the intial red theme to an 
entire color set, cleaned things up a bit, and here we are.  As of Mate version 
1.20.4, these themes still seem to work.  Hopefully they will continue to 
function nicely for some time...

This theme seems to be covered under the GNU Lesser General Public License 
in the official Mate git repos (I think?); so I've included it here.  
So, should you, for some ungodly reason, decide to modify this mess; 
make sure you follow the terms of the GPL.
