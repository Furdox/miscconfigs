 
I like lying to myself that I like everyone I meet
It's a funny little cycle,do it while I fall asleep
If I do it everyday and if I do it every week
Then I just might become a better man you wanted out of me
I got cellophane wrapped around the lining of my throat
If you ever hear me breathing then that breathing is a joke
Please be nice to me and I will do exactly what I'm told
Simple, I get to be dumb, you get to exercise control
Exercise control
Exercise control
Can you please just check again?
I'd become fucking destitute before I'd be your man
There are wires overheadandthere are wires in your hand
You pull the plug on me, I switch you up again (It's your problem)
It's your problem
It's your problem
It's your problem
It's your problem
I just make this shit so you can lose yourâ€”
I got lucky, I do it all the time
I do it 'cause I like it and I like it 'cause its mine
Everyday I take a minute of your time
And I keep them in a box, I organise them all by size
Yeah I want it, I want it quite a lot
I'm in it 'cause I can be, you can't tell me that I'm not
Are you stupid?
The paint is what's inside
I pull out all my blood vessels and lay them out like vines
Wrapped around the lining of my throat
If you ever hear me breathing then that breathing is a joke
Please be nice to me and I will do exactly what I'm told
Simple, I get to be dumb, you get to exercise
It's your problem
It's your problem
It's your problem
It's your problem
It's your problem
It's your problem
It's your problem
It's your problem
It's your problem
