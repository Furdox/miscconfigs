[Intro]
This ain't what you want
This ain't what you want
This ain't what you want
This ain't what you want
This ain't what you want
This ain't what you want
This ain't what you want
This ain't what you want
 
[Verse 1]
Car go zoom, I'm immune to the bullshit
Go crazy like I'm tooled up stupid with the new shit
Who rules the nuisance, I'm the future of this new shit
Nobody better, I'm a winner of this new shit
Harder to sink, I'm a product of riches
Nobody out there living lavish on this sick shit
I break the covers and I sell it like a risk
I feel like Banksy, how I'm anti on this sick shit
Too fast, they can not catch me I'm too quick, bitch
Oh damn, I'm way too nasty like a lynching
Hold back, no way, I'm going with my fist in
So sad, like this money's gonna fix things, uh
Back up on my riches cus' I'm getting some, uh
I just made 8 figures but it's not enough
Yeah, maybe I'm too distant, I should get in touch
Uh, money was the mission, I don't give a f-
 
[Chorus]
Uhm, you're too angry
Huh? You're too angry
Scar, you're too angry
Calm down, you're too angry
Wait
You're, too, angry
 
[Verse 2]
I, hate being, patient, patient
I wish, I, could, get, the, shit, I want now
Now
 
[Chorus]
You're too angry
Huh? You're too angry
Scar, you're too angry
Calm down, you're too angry
Wait
You're, too, angry, ah
 
[Outro]
Yeah
