[Intro: zombAe]
I'm in your city, bitch
I'm in your city
I'm in your city, bitch
I'm in your— (A-a-animal)
I'm in your city, bitch
I'm in your city
I'm in your city, bitch
I'm in your city, bitch! (Uh)
 
[Verse 1: zombAe]
Bitch I'm in your city come catch me
Came by himself he gon' leave in a baggie
He think that I'm soft 'cause I'm masking
Catch him in streets and I stretch him like taffy
Mom gone so you know I'm a bastard
Can't talk 'bout opps when I stay with the crackers
Way we rip him you think it's a bad dream
Keep on the mask he can't tell that I'm-
 
[Chorus: zombAe]
I'm on dumb, shit
You can't tell that I move stupid
Bitch we dump, shit
Shooting everyone like Cupid
Better run, quick
Ain't no telling what I'm doing
Ain't no telling what I'm using
Picked my life and how I'll lose it, yeah!
 
[Verse 2: zombAe]
I'll turn this function to bits
Jump in, I'm dumping the clip
Funcrusher plus to these niggas
Your budget's nothing to this
Keep throwing faith in a hole
It's population control
Tеll you to go hit a lick
So they can go and clean out your home
Thеse distracted pockets remain the easiest picked
If it ain't your presentation they'll get on you for your skin, ayy
Nothing on the internet gon' help you with your woes
All it got for you is niggas in some European clothes
 
[Interlude]
Look at Possum, there he lies
Children meet his lifeless eyes
See his nasty legs and tongue
When he wakens, watch him run
 
[Verse 3: zombAe]
Death in Gaza, Trail of Tears
Make a nigga wanna go on tour for years
Doesn't fucking matter if I persevere
If the audience does not exist when curtains clear
Invictus 'til victors determine the spoils
Phyrexian crackers gon' die over oil
The rest of us got shades pulled over our eyes
When the worth of a life is worth less than the price
Of the shit that we put in our bodies of Christ
Fight or flight numbed by the constant inciting
Of opposing suits in a folie à deux
Expect nothing but voting and polling of you
So you tap, retweet and the scrolling resumes
And let it feed right into urges
Seen more niggas mad at the next person's at
Than the fact that we're leaving in hearses
R.I.P Nex
 
[Chorus: zombAe]
Shit, you can't tell that I move stupid
Bitch we dump, shit
Shooting everyone like Cupid
Better run, quick
Ain't no telling what I'm doing
Ain't no telling what I'm using
This my life and how I lose it, yeah!
Dumb, shit
You can't tell that I move stupid
Bitch we dump, shit
Shooting everyone like Cupid
Better run, quick
Ain't no telling what I'm doing
Ain't no telling what I'm using
This my life and how I lose it, yeah!
 
[Outro]
Watch him run
