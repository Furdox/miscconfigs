[Intro]
(Your name's not down)
[?]
 
[Verse 1: Femtanyl]
We never stop bleeding
We lock our legs and start to drown
You made me the culture
It just wraps back to back around
Lymph node infection
Go spit those leeches on the ground
It’s just seizures on repeat now
It's just back to back to back
 
[Verse 2: Femtanyl]
I was up in life
Until you popped the nerves inside my eyes
You pushed your thumbs in deeper
I felt it in my spine
But now I feel much better
'Cause I don’t gotta see what they say online
You made my mind up for me
Think I'll just stick to me and mine
 
[Bridge]
(Please bеlieve me, you'll kill pеople)
(Nurse)
(Listen to me)
(Nurse)
(Take your life, David, before you kill others)
 
[Verse 3: Femtanyl]
You scream past my head
My arms locked by my sides
I sprint, run for cover
You die in a knife fight
I trip and fall upwards
I stretch across the sky
My limbs stress and shatter
My lungs pop, I can't cry
I fall
 
[Verse 4: Danny Brown]
Check, uh, what?
Style, go
Turn it up, loud and clear now
All these hoes sound the same like [?]
Y'all get nasty, y'all get to actin'
[1:20?] the games a game [quit stalling us?]
[1:23?] y'all messed up
Better watch out ’cause you’re not like us
K-keep it on hush, like, turn it down low
Actin' like [trippin’ like?] there ain't much mo', like there [?]
You ain't gotta [1:30?], okay let’s go
They're made of [1:32?] that way
Buckle up fast, [we're acting now?]
I don't give a fuck who next
Better wake up, or you might get slapped
I-I won't bite, man, watch yo' step
Bust your head, what do you think about that? Style
 
[Verse 5: Femtanyl]
I've got a girl and we're best friends, I hope that we'll get out of this okay
Find me on the street, teeth shattered on the pavement
I get up and bite for another taste, puke on stage
And I'm fighting for my pride in the pit 'til the skin's ripped off my face
This is my life and you can never take that
You will never put me in my grave
 
[Outro]
Please don't cry
