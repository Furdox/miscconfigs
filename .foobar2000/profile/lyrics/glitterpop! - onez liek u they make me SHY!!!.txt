[Verse 1]
Oh, I've heard all about you
All those things they had to say
You’re a legend 'round this school
Locally famous drama queen
Turn my eyes, I see you stare
Cross the room and right at me
Now you're smiling like you’ve got
Like you've got something on your mind
 
You've been here before
Make me feel like you're a
Wild animal
I'm all you want
 
[Chorus]
If I could go back in time
I'd shoot my shot
I'd risk it all
If I could go back in time
I'd shoot my shot
Just so I could have a chance
With you
With you
 
[Verse 2]
You are always on my mind
Sitting here, I am waiting
Ones like you, they make me shy
Innocently intimidating
 
You’ve been here before
Make me feel like you’re a
Wild animal
I'm all you want
