I'm like "Hey, what's up? Hello"
Seen your pretty ass soon as you came in the door
I just wanna chill, got a sack for us to roll
Married to the money, introduced her to my stove
Showed her how to whip it, now she remixing for low
She my trap queen, let her hit the bando
We be counting up, watch how far them bands go
We just set a goal, talking matching Lambos
At 56 a gram, 5 a 100 grams though
Man, I swear I love her, how she work the damn pole
Hit the strip club, we be letting bands go
Everybody hating, we just call them fans, though
In love with the money, I ain't never letting go
 
And I get high with my baby
I just left the mall, I'm getting fly with my baby, yeah
And I can ride with my baby
I be in the kitchen cooking pies with my baby, yeah
And I can ride with my baby
I just left the mall, I'm getting fly with my baby, yeah
And I can ride with my baby
I be in the kitchen cooking pies
 
I'm like, "Hey, what's up? Hello"
 
I hit the strip with my trap queen, 'cause all we know is
bands
I just might snatch up a 'Rari and buy my boo a Lamb'
I might just snatch her a necklace, drop a couple on a ring
She ain't wanting for nothing because I got her everything
It's big ZooWap from the bando
Remind me where I can't go
Remy Boyz got the stamp though
Count up hella them bands though
Boy how far can your bands go?
Fetty Wap, I'm living fifty thousand K how I stand though

Sounding like a zillion bucks on the track
(She my trap queen)
I got whatever on my boy, whatever

Money out of sight cause fights
Put up or shut up, huh?
