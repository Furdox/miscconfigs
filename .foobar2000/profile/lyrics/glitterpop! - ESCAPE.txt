I-I can't seem to escape from my head
Too many sleepless nights to count-ount-ount-ount-ount
And now too many people want me dead
I guess I should appease the crowd
 
Th-th-th-there's a lot going on
All inside of my brain
And I can't seem to escape
Killing myself is the only way to stop all of the pain
 
And I can't seem to escape
There's a lot going on-o-o-o
All inside of my brain
And I can't seem to escape
Killing myself is the only way to stop all of the pain
And I can't seem to escape-ape-ape-ape
 
I wish i didn't do some things where
I really wish I could move on
My words don't really matter to you
Now everybody's gone
I wish i didn't do some things where
I really wish I could move on
My words don't really matter to you
Now everybody's gone, go-go-gone
 
Gone
Go-go
Go-gone
Go-go-go
Gone
Go-go
Go-Gone
 
(Gone, gone)
 
T-t-there's a lot going on
All inside of my brain
And I can't seem to escape
Killing myself is the only way to stop all of the pain
 
And I can't seem to escape
There's a lot going on-o-o-o
All inside of my brain
And I can't seem to escape
Killing myself is the only way to stop all of the pain
And I can't seem to escape-ape-ape-ape-ape-ape
